<p>
This is a board game made-up by a couple of brilliant minds.
<p>
MOHAR consists of 2 players each having 5 pawns.
This game is made in C amd has the following basic moves :
<ul>
<li>You can move the pawn either down or up or right or left.</li>
<li>But there are restrictions in order to make the game interesting.</li>
<li>The player cannot move the pawn through walls.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main motive of the game is to form triplets using the pawns.
<p>And once a triplet is formed at three particular locations, next time you will not allowed to form triplets there.
<p>There is a space right in the middle of the 5X5 board in which the player is not allowed to place the pawns.
<p>The restriction a player will be facing is, a triplet cannot be formed trough walls. It means a wall cannot obstruct the trio.
<p>A player wins when 3 such trio forms at three different triplet of locations.
<p>Or lets say when the opponent is left with only 2 pawns, the other player wins.
